# ImgApp

    A simple Image app for uploading images with JavaScript and MongoDB.

## Prerequisites:

    To get started with the app, install 'nodejs'.
    You can find the latest version of NodeJS from
[Official website](https://nodejs.org/).
    With NodeJS, you also get the latest version of npm

    Check both, using following commands:

    `node -v`

    and

    `npm -v`

    - Install required modules from npm using:

    ```bash
    npm Install
    ```

    To run the application, from the root of the project, execute following command:

    `npm start`

    This will launch the server on port 3300. You can visit the app at:
    [http://localhost:3300](http://localhost:3300).
